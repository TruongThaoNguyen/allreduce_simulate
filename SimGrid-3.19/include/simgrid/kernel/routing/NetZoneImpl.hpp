/** @ingroup ROUTING_API
 *  @brief Private implementation of the Networking Zones
 *
 * A netzone is a network container, in charge of routing information between elements (hosts and sub-netzones)
 * and to the nearby netzones. In SimGrid, there is a hierarchy of netzones, ie a tree with a unique root
 * NetZone, that you can retrieve with simgrid::s4u::Engine::netRoot().
 *
 * The purpose of the kernel::routing module is to retrieve the routing path between two points in a time- and
 * space-efficient manner. This is done by NetZoneImpl::getGlobalRoute(), called when creating a communication to
 * retrieve both the list of links that the create communication will use, and the summed latency that these
 * links represent.
 *
 * The network model could recompute the latency by itself from the list, but it would require an additional
 * traversal of the link set. This operation being on the critical path of SimGrid, the routing computes the
 * latency on the behalf of the network while constructing the link set.
 *
 * Finding the path between two nodes is rather complex because we navigate a hierarchy of netzones, each of them
 * being a full network. In addition, the routing can declare shortcuts (called bypasses), either within a NetZone
 * at the route level or directly between NetZones. Also, each NetZone can use a differing routing algorithm, depending
 * on its class. @ref FullZone have a full matrix giving explicitly the path between any pair of their
 * contained nodes, while @ref DijkstraZone or @ref FloydZone rely on a shortest path algorithm. @ref VivaldiZone
 * does not even have any link but only use only coordinate information to compute the latency.
 *
 * So NetZoneImpl::getGlobalRoute builds the path recursively asking its specific information to each traversed NetZone
 * with NetZoneImpl::getLocalRoute, that is redefined in each sub-class.
 * The algorithm for that is explained in http://hal.inria.fr/hal-00650233/ (but for historical reasons, NetZones are
 * called Autonomous Systems in this article).
 *
