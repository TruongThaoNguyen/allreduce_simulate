SimGrid comes with many examples provided in the examples/ directory.
Those examples are described in section \ref msg_examples. Those
examples are commented and should be easy to understand. for a first
step into SimGrid we also provide some more detailed examples in the
sections below.

Here are some examples on how to use MSG, the most used API.

MSG comes with an extensive set of examples. It is sometimes difficult
to find the one you need. This list aims at helping you finding the
example from which you can learn what you want to.

\subsection MSG_ex_basics Basic examples and features

\subsubsection MSG_ex_master_worker Basic Master/Workers

Simulation of a master-worker application using a realistic platform and an external description of the deployment.

   - \ref MSG_ext_mw_master

\dontinclude msg/app-masterworker/app-masterworker.c

\paragraph MSG_ext_mw_preliminary Preliminary declarations

\skip include
\until example");
\skipline Master expects

\paragraph MSG_ext_mw_master Master code

This function has to be assigned to a #msg_process_t that will behave as the master. It should not be called directly 
but either given as a parameter to #MSG_process_create() or registered as a public function through 
#MSG_function_register() and then automatically assigned to a process through #MSG_launch_application().

C style arguments (argc/argv) are interpreted as:
   - the number of tasks to distribute
   - the computational size of each task
   - the communication size of each task
   - the number of workers managed by the master.

Tasks are evenly sent in a round-robin style.

\until return 0;
\until }
\skipline Worker expects

\paragraph MSG_ext_mw_worker Worker code

This function has to be assigned to a #msg_process_t that has to behave as a worker. Just like the master function 
(described in \ref MSG_ext_mw_master), it should not be called directly.

C style arguments (argc/argv) are interpreted as:
   - a unique id used to build the mailbox name of the worker

This function keeps waiting for tasks and executes them as it receives them. When a special task named 'finalize' is
received from the master, the process ends its execution.

\until return 0;
\until }

\paragraph MSG_ext_mw_core Main function

This function is the core of the simulation and is divided only into 3 parts:
   -# Simulation settings : #MSG_create_environment() creates a realistic
      environment
   -# Application deployment : create the processes on the right locations with
      #MSG_launch_application()
   -# The simulation is run with #MSG_main()

Its arguments are:
   - <i>platform_file</i>: the name of a file containing an valid platform description.
   - <i>deployment_file</i>: the name of a file containing a valid application description
\line main
\until OK;
\until }

\paragraph MSG_ext_mw_platform Example of a platform file

The following platform description can be found in \c examples/msg/platforms/small_platform.xml
\include platforms/small_platform.xml

\paragraph MSG_ext_mw_application Example of a deployment file

The following application description can be found in \c examples/msg/app-masterworker/app-masterworker_d.xml:

\include msg/app-masterworker/app-masterworker_d.xml
