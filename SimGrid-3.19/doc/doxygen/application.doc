/** 
@page application Describing your application

TBD

* Main concepts

  - *Actor* (or process in legacy interfaces of SimGrid)
  
  - *Activities*: resource usage that applications do. This is what
    takes time.
    
    Any given actor can do at most one foreground activity, while it
    can also do several non-blocking activities in the background.
    
  - These activities take place on *Resources* (links, compute
    machine, disks). Resources should be described (created) in the
    Virtual Platform (link), but your application have many other ways
    to interact with the resource.  

  - The resources are arranged in a hierarchy of *Networking Zones*,
    with which the application can also interact. The netzone knows the
    networking path between one resource to another.

Speak of mailboxes here? Where if not?

* Interfaces to describe applications

- Simple C++ interface: S4U that is currently designed
- Simple Legacy C interfaces: MSG and SimDag, with comparison.
- Simple Java Interface: Currently MSG-based, but will be replaced with S4U stuff when ready
- MPI applications

- Arbitrary applications: Simterpose and Remote SimGrid (they are currently far from being usable).
- State our goal of BYOS (build your own simulator), even if it's just a neat name for now
