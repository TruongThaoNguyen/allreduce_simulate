###
### Urgent stuff:
###

* Have a proper todo file

###
### Ongoing stuff
###

* Clean up CMake files
   Non exhaustive list of subgoals:
   - Use genuine cmake mechanisms and variables when available,
     instead of reinventing the wheel.
   - Correctly determine system and architecture (e.g. x32).
   - Correctly determine compiler type and version (e.g. clang).
   - Use git to generate the dist archive.  Either use git-archive to
     generate the tarball, or keep using cmake -E tar, but use git-ls-files
     to get the list of files to pack.

* Replace XBT with the C++ standard library

* Some XBT datacontainers seem to overlap. Kill some/all of them.
    - replace set with SWAG
